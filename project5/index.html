    Welcome to Ashley Kaoâ€™s portfolio! Here, you will find her previous experiences, an overview of her resume, her skills, and more. 

<h1>About Me</h1>
    My name is Ashley Kao. I am a third-year student at Syracuse University. I am a double major in Innovation, Society and Technology and Linguistics. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in UX/UI Design or in Linguistics research, particularly in the fields of Sociolinguistics and Second Language Acquisition. I am especially interested in the relationship between human language development and machine learning. Additionally, I am passionate about the accessibilty of information and technology, as well as human interactions with technology.
    
    I am from San Diego, California. Many people ask me how I feel about the weather in Syracuse, and while the snow was a big adjustment, I have come to love the changing colors of the seasons. Outside of school, I enjoy crocheting, watching shows and movies, going to the beach, going on adventures, and spending time with friends and family.
