            Hi, my name is Ashley Kao. I am a Junior double majoring in Linguistics and Innovation, Society and Technology. I am interested in second language acquisition, particularly how it applies to machine learning and AI. I am also interested in UX Design and Human Computer Interactions. 
        </p>

            Last year, I had the opportunity to work as a <strong>SOURCE Research Assistant</strong> in a project researching AI and ways the media reported about it. I also was a <strong>WellsLink Peer Mentor</strong> where I advised and supported four freshmen through the initial stages of their college journey.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        Outside of school, I enjoy crocheting, watching shows/movies, hanging out with friends and family, and going to the beach. Coming from California, the adjustment to the scenery in Syracuse was difficult at first, but Iâ€™ve come to love the changing colors of nature throughout each season. Below are more things I enjoy about Syracuse.

        <ul>
            <li>Crunchy leaves in the Fall season.</li>
            <li>The changing colors of nature all around campus.</li>
            <li>The in-between weather when it's cold but not too cold.</li>
        </ul>
