        Hi, my name is Ashley Kao. I am a Junior double majoring in Linguistics and Innovation, Society and Technology. I am interested in second language acquisition, particularly how it applies to machine learning and AI. I am also interested in UX Design and Human Computer Interactions. Last year, I had the opportunity to work as a SOURCE Research Assistant in a project researching AI and ways the media reported about it. I also was a WellsLink Peer Mentor where I advised and supported four freshmen through the initial stages of their college journey. Outside of school, I enjoy crocheting, watching shows/movies, hanging out with friends and family, and going to the beach. Coming from California, the adjustment to the scenery in Syracuse was difficult at first, but Iâ€™ve come to love the changing colors of nature throughout each season.
