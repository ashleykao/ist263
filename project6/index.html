        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ashley Kao. I am a third-year student at Syracuse University double majoring in <b>Innovation,
                Society and Technology</b> and <b>Linguistics</b>. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in <i>UX/UI
                Design</i> or in
            <i>Linguistics research</i>, particularly in the fields of Sociolinguistics and Second Language Acquisition.
            I am
            especially interested in the relationship between human language development and machine learning.
            Additionally,
            I am passionate about the accessibility of information and technology, as well as human interactions with
            technology. Outside of school, I am a member of Alpha Phi Omega, the professional service fraternity.
            <br>

            I am from San Diego, California. Many people ask me how I feel about the weather in Syracuse, and while the
            snow
            was a big adjustment, I have come to love the changing colors of the seasons. Outside of school, I enjoy
            crocheting, watching shows and movies, going to the beach, going on adventures, and spending time with
            friends
            and family.

        Below are images of my friends and scenery I enjoy. I believe in taking in the precious moments in life, which
        are reflected in these images.
