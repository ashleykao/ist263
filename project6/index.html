    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Ashley Kao. I am a third-year student at Syracuse University double majoring in <b>Innovation,
        Society and Technology</b> and <b>Linguistics</b>. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in <i>UX/UI Design</i> or in
        <i>Linguistics research</i>, particularly in the fields of Sociolinguistics and Second Language Acquisition. I am
        especially interested in the relationship between human language development and machine learning. Additionally,
        I am passionate about the accessibility of information and technology, as well as human interactions with
        technology. Outside of school, I am a member of Alpha Phi Omega, the professional service fraternity. 
        <br>

        I am from San Diego, California. Many people ask me how I feel about the weather in Syracuse, and while the snow
        was a big adjustment, I have come to love the changing colors of the seasons. Outside of school, I enjoy
        crocheting, watching shows and movies, going to the beach, going on adventures, and spending time with friends
        and family.
