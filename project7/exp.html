                Since the start of my college career, I have had an interest in the <b>intersection</b> between
                Linguistics and Technology. With my combined majors, I offer a unique perspective on the affordances
                one has when interacting with an information system, especially concerning the language that is used
                within these systems. Through my experiences as a student, a mentor, and a research assistant, I
                have been able to gain an understanding of how important <b>inclusivity and accessibility</b> in the
                realm of human computer interaction is.

                        In Spring 2024, I took LIN406 Field Methods with Dr. Adam Singerman. Our class worked with a
                        native
                        speaker consultant of Ancash Quechua (AQ) to build a general understanding of the broad
                        characteristics
                        of the language and its verbal morphology. At the end of the semester, I presented my findings
                        with
                        my
                        classmates at the Linguistic Studies Research Fest hosted by the Langauges, Literature, and
                        Linguistics
                        department at Syracuse University.

                        From May 2023-May 2024, I was a Research Assistant with the Syracuse Office of Undergraduate
                        Research
                        and Creative Engagement (SOURCE). Led by Professors Mark Linder and Emily Pellicano from the
                        School
                        of
                        Architecture, I collaborated with two other students in a transdisciplinary research project
                        tracking
                        the reporting and usage of Artificial Intelligence. We presented our preliminary findings at the
                        Fall
                        2023 SOURCE Resesarch Expo.

                        In Spring 2024, I took LIN431 Phonological Analysis with Dr. Chris Green, in which we analyzed
                        the
                        Nupoid languages. Our class was given raw data collected by Professor Constanze Weise (Eastern
                        Tennessee
                        State University) and her team in Nigeria to analyze for phonological rules and characteristics.
                        I
                        worked with a graduate student on Kami, specifically, and later presented the class' general
                        findings at
                        the Spring 2024 College of Arts and Sciences Research Fair with my classmates.
